# Welcome to Humanities Fall

Here we will attempt to verify all sources and arguments Dr. Lana Corrine Cantrell makes use of in her book, "The Greatest Story Never Told - A Scientific Inquiry into the Evidence of the Fall of Man from a Higher Civilization in Antiquity". This will be used to establish whether her theory is plausible.

[A copy of the book can be downloaded at archive.org in various formats](https://archive.org/details/THEGREATESTSTORYNEVERTOLDDr.LanaCantrell).
