# Welcome to Humanities Fall

Here we will attempt to verify all sources and arguments Dr. Lana Corrine Cantrell makes use of in her book, "The Greatest Story Never Told - A Scientific Inquiry into the Evidence of the Fall of Man from a Higher Civilization in Antiquity". This will be used to establish whether her theory is plausible.

## FOREWORD

Our best two examples are from NASA itself, [Josef P. Blumrich][1] and [Maurice Chatelain][2]. Blumrich was Chief of the Systems Layout Branch of NASA, a skeptic until he read the story of Ezekial and therein found the exact description of a spaceship and wrote his book, [SPACESHIPS OF EZEKIAL][3], using his technical acumen of aeronautics to discern what went on here. Another superb book is ["OUR ANCESTORS CAME FROM OUTER SPACE" A NASA Expert Confirms Mankinds Exterrestriai Origins][4] (Doubleday & Company, Inc., NY-1978) by Maurice Chatelain.
